# RRFLibraries

To build this project, import it into Eclipse Mars 2, select the desired configuration
(SAM3X_RTOS, SAM4E_RTOS, etc.), and press Build. The build depends on the Eclipse
workspace variable 'GccPath_Arm_7_2018_q2" being set to the directory where your
arm-none-eabi-g++ compiler resides. For example
"C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\7 2018-q2-update\bin" on Windows.
To set it, go to Windows -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Build -> Build Variables and click "Add..."
